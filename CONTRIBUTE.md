============

In order to run the Jeckyll server you must do this:

```bash
gem install bundle
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open the `Server address` (usually, http://127.0.0.1:4000/) and code until you're happy with the result.

Then send a PR and one of our kind elves will eventually merge it.

_Disclaimer: you might have your PR corrected if you're wrong, [you know](https://xkcd.com/386/) ;-)_
